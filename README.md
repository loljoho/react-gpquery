Dashboard web application for Grand Prix motor racing statistics

## Overview

**GPQuery** uses the [Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/), an experimental web service for historical motor racing data.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) ([original README here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)).

Data visualizations are generated with [D3.js](https://d3js.org).

```
git clone https://github.com/loljoho/gpquery.git

## License

Still gotta work this one out.  For now, please contact us if you have any questions!
